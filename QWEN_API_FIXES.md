# Qwen API Fixes - Summary of Issues and Resolutions

## Problems Found

### 1. Silent Error Handling (Critical Issue)
**Problem**: The `providers/openrouter_qwen.py` provider was catching all exceptions and returning error strings instead of raising exceptions. This prevented proper error handling and made debugging nearly impossible.

**Example of the problem**:
```python
# Before (BAD):
try:
    # API call
except Exception as e:
    return f"[error:qwen] {e}"  # Returns error string instead of raising
```

**Impact**: 
- Errors appeared as bot responses like `[error:qwen] Network error`
- No way to catch and handle errors properly in calling code
- Conversation would appear to work but return error messages as chat responses
- Made it impossible to implement proper retry logic or error recovery

**Resolution**:
```python
# After (GOOD):
try:
    # API call
except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"OpenRouter API request failed: {e}") from e
```

### 2. Missing API Key Validation (Critical Issue)
**Problem**: When `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` was not set, the provider only printed to stderr and continued initialization, leading to cryptic errors later.

**Example of the problem**:
```python
# Before (BAD):
if not self.api_key:
    print("Missing OPENROUTER_API_KEY for Qwen provider", file=sys.stderr)
    # Continues anyway, causing errors later
```

**Impact**:
- Confusing error messages appearing deep in the call stack
- No clear indication of what was wrong
- Difficult for users to diagnose the problem

**Resolution**:
```python
# After (GOOD):
if not self.api_key:
    raise RuntimeError("OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set. Set it in OS env or in a .env file.")
```

### 3. Incorrect Model Names (Configuration Issue)
**Problem**: The `agents/agents.yml` configuration file had incorrect model names missing the `qwen/` prefix required by OpenRouter's API.

**Before**: `qwen2.5-7b-instruct:free`
**After**: `qwen/qwen2.5-7b-instruct:free`

**Impact**:
- API requests would fail with "model not found" errors
- Even with proper API key and network access, requests would fail

## How to Use the Fixed Implementation

### 1. Set up your API key
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...
```

### 2. Run the chatbot
```bash
# Single prompt
python chatbot.py --provider qwen --once "Hello!"

# Interactive chat
python chatbot.py --provider qwen
```

### 3. Override the model (optional)
```bash
python chatbot.py --provider qwen --model qwen/qwen2.5-7b-instruct:free --once "Test"
```

## Error Messages You Should Now See

### Before the fixes:
- `[error:qwen] <urlopen error [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname>` (returned as chat message)
- Silent failures with cryptic stderr messages

### After the fixes:
- `RuntimeError: OPENROUTER_API_KEY is not set. Set it in OS env or in a .env file.`
- `RuntimeError: OpenRouter API request failed: <urlopen error [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname>`
- `RuntimeError: OpenRouter API returned malformed response: {...}`

All errors are now proper exceptions with clear messages and proper exception chaining for debugging.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

The test suite now includes:
- 19 original tests for the chatbot and legacy providers
- 7 new tests specifically for the OpenRouter Qwen provider
- 1 agent bootstrap test
- **Total: 27 tests, all passing**

New tests cover:
- API key validation
- Error handling for network failures
- Error handling for malformed API responses
- Successful API calls with mocked responses
- Default model usage
- Custom base URL configuration

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Add retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient network errors
2. **Add rate limiting**: Handle API rate limit responses gracefully
3. **Add request/response logging**: For debugging in production
4. **Add timeout configuration**: Make timeout configurable per request
5. **Add better error categorization**: Distinguish between network errors, API errors, and auth errors

## Conclusion

The Qwen API integration is now working correctly with proper error handling. Users will receive clear error messages when something goes wrong, and the system will fail fast with actionable information rather than silently returning error strings as chat responses.
