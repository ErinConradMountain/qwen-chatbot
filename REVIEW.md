# Repository Health Report

## Automated Checks
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (already satisfied)
- `pytest` fails during collection: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chatbot'` when importing `tests/test_chatbot.py`.
- `ruff check` passes with no findings.
- `black --check` suggests reformatting `chatbot.py`, `src/config.py`, and `src/providers/qwen_provider.py`.
- `mypy .` reports missing type stubs for `requests` and incompatible assignments where the module fallback is set to `None`. It also flags the OpenAI call signature and `.strip()` on a possible `None`.
- `bandit -r .` reports low-severity issues: broad `except Exception` in `src/config.py` and multiple `assert` statements in tests.

## Notable Code Issues
1. Pytest cannot import the root-level `chatbot` module when running under `pytest --import-mode=importlib`. Packaging the CLI inside a package (for example, moving it into `src/`) or adjusting `sys.path` in tests would resolve this.
2. Assigning `requests = None` when the import fails leads to type errors and potential runtime attribute errors. Use `from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional` and guard usage instead.
3. `openai_infer` assumes the response always includes `message.content` and calls `.strip()` without guarding against `None`, which raises an exception for tool outputs or streaming responses.
4. `QwenProvider.chat` lacks error handling for networking issues and returns `data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]` without validating the API response shape.
5. Tests rely on simple `assert` statements; consider using `pytest` assertion helpers or explicit `assert` messages for clarity.

## Pull Request #1 Observations
- Introduces Qwen provider integration, config loading, and CLI scaffold.
- Missing unit tests for non-mock providers and for CLI argument parsing.
- Does not update documentation with instructions for obtaining `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or running Qwen provider.
- Should include dependency pinning for `requests` and `python-dotenv` or document them as optional extras.
